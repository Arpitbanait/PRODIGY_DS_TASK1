# PRODIGY_DS_TASK1
Task 1 Completed â€“ Data Visualization ðŸ“Š
I am pleased to share that I have successfully completed Task 1 of my internship at Prodigy InfoTech.
In this task, I worked with an Electric Vehicle dataset to create histograms and bar graphs using Python (Matplotlib & Pandas). The visualizations were designed to highlight key patterns and distributions within the data, enabling clear and data-driven insights.
Key learnings from this task:
Data cleaning and preprocessing for accurate analysis
Constructing histograms to visualize numeric data distribution
Creating bar plots to compare categorical data
Enhancing plots with labels, colors, and grids for better readability
I look forward to applying these skills to more complex datasets in the upcoming tasks.
